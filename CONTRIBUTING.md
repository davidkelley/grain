# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome, and thanks in advance for your help!  Please follow these simple guidelines :)

# How to contribute to Grain

## When you want to propose a new feature or bug fix
* Please make sure there is an open issue discussing your Contribution.
* If there isn't, please open an issue so we can talk about it before you invest time into the Implementation.
* When creating an issue follow the guide that Github shows so we have enough information about your proposal.

## Pull Requests
Please follow these Pull Request guidelines when creating Pull Requests:
* If an Issue exists, leave a comment there that you are working on a solution so nobody else jumps on it.
* If an Issue does not exist, create a new Issue, detail your changes.  We recommend waiting until we accept it, so you don't waste your precious time.
* Start commit messages with a lowercase verb such as "add", "fix", "refactor", "remove".
* Submit your PR.
* Reference the issue in your PR.

## Issues
Please follow these Issue guidelines for opening Issues:
* Make sure your Issue is not a duplicate.
* Make sure your Issue is for a *feature request*, *bug report*, or *a discussion about a relevant topic*.

## Providing Support
The easiest thing you can do to help me move forward and make an impact on our progress is to simply provide support to other people having difficulties getting started with Grain. You can do that by replying to [issues on Github](https://github.com/davidkelley/grain/issues).

## Improving Documentation
Maintaining and updating the docs on a regular basis is a hard task. The more eyeballs on the docs the higher quality it'll get and the less chances there will be for typos and confusion. We keep our docs simple and in the main repo. If you see any issues with our docs, simply open an issue or a PR.
