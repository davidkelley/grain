# Grain Server

The server component of Grain is written using the [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) and provides several lambda functions that emulate an API for the EC2 Metadata service. You can deploy the functions on multiple stages, in-order to determine the level of access provided for each stage. Such stages could be named, `read-only`, `development` or `administrator`.

For example, deploying a stage `development` on the AWS Region `us-east-1` (`-s development -r us-east-1`), would create a role `development.us-east-1@grain`in IAM, that can be controlled by attaching custom or managed policies in the AWS Console.

The initial setup also creates a "master" API Key which can be used to create keys via the CLI, for users on the associated stage.

The deployment process can be repeated for as many times as there are required access roles.

## Getting Started

**All Docker containers provided in the Grain project are signed and verified. Never trust and don't ever deploy anything to your AWS Account from an unsigned container.**

You can either run `docker pull --disable-content-trust=false davidkelley/grain:server-v0.1.0` or build the container yourself with the following command `docker build -t <username>/grain:server-v0.1.0 .` from inside the `server/` directory.

_Note: When building the container on your local machine, you can supply a `$ver` arg to configure which release of Serverless is installed globally._

## Deploying the functions

You can use the container to deploy the functions to AWS using the commands below.

```
docker run -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret> -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<id> davidkelley/grain:server-v0.1.0 serverless deploy -s <stage> -r <region>
```

* `<id>`: Your AWS Key ID. Preferably a Super User key.
* `<secret>`: The accompanying secret to the Key ID.
* `<stage>`: The stage to deploy the functions to.
* `<region>`: The AWS region to deploy to, for example, `us-east-1`.

**Note:** It will deploy the function to `us-east-1`.

After you have successfully deployed the functions to your account, take note of the API Key that was generated and refer back to the main [README.md](https://github.com/davidkelley/grain) for this repository.

---

Alternatively, if you have Serverless (~v1.0) installed you can clone this repository and use the CLI to deploy the functions directly.

## Testing the functions

Tests are executed using Mocha and the Serverless plugin, `serverless-mocha-plugin`. You can run the tests using the below command.

```
docker run davidkelley/grain:server-v0.1.0 serverless invoke test
```
